### About the Experiment 

The Fitch-Margoliash (FM) algorithm is a distance-based method for reconstructing phylogenetic trees, widely used in evolutionary biology. It estimates tree topology by minimizing the squared differences between observed and predicted pairwise distances, ensuring an optimal representation of evolutionary relationships. The algorithm is particularly effective when dealing with molecular sequence data, providing a computationally efficient approach to infer phylogenies. This experiment guides users through the process of constructing a phylogenetic tree using the FM algorithm, demonstrating how genetic distances translate into evolutionary relationships among species.
